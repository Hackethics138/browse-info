## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a cybercrime strategy in which attackers assume the identity of reliable organizations in order to trick victims into disclosing private information, including passwords, usernames, and bank account information. To fool people, they usually use phony emails, texts, or websites that seem like authentic sources.

The intention is to take advantage of people’s confidence by deceiving victims into unintentionally giving sensitive information, which may then be exploited for financial fraud, identity theft, or illegal account access. In order to protect themselves against phishing attempts, users should be wary of requests for personal information that are not requested and should always double-check the legitimacy of the sender.
